# gomoku
Gomoku is a two-player traditional Japanese board game in which players take turns arranging pieces on a 19x19 board. The game's goal is to create a continuous line of 5 placements.

main.cpp contains the code that runs the main game. The code in this file is minimal due to the usage of classes.
gomoku.h is a header file that includes the functions that control the general functionality of the game.
gomoku.cpp is a class file containing functions declaration that would control the overall operation and set-up of the Gomoku game.

You only have to run the main.cpp file when compiling the code through the command line
